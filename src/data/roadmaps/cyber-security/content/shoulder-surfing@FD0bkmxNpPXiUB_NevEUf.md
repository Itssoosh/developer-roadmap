# Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is the act of gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information by observing someone as they enter it. This technique is commonly used by attackers in public spaces, such as offices, cafes, or airports, where people might be entering passwords, PINs, or other confidential data. The attacker positions themselves to get a clear view of the victim's screen or keypad, exploiting trust and a lack of awareness in crowded environments. This simple yet effective method takes advantage of human behavior and can compromise both digital and physical security.
